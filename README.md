# Retail-Analysis---Atliq-Mart

Objective: Analyze datasets related to promotions run by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024, identifying successful and unsuccessful promotions and providing actionable insights for future strategies.

Key Insights:

Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad have the most stores out of 50, with Bengaluru leading.
The Diwali Campaign generated the highest Incremental Revenue, while Sankranti saw the highest Incremental sold units.
Promotions like "500 cashback" and "BOGOF" performed exceptionally well, while "25% off" led to significant losses.
Products under the "Personal Care" category did not perform well in both campaigns.

Recommendations:

Expand stores to other cities beyond Bengaluru, Chennai, and Hyderabad to reach untapped consumer segments.
Focus on maintaining or increasing incremental revenue for Diwali and enhancing the quantity sold after promotions. For Sankranti, continue emphasizing promotions that drive high quantities sold.
Implement "500 cashback" and "BOGOF" promotions extensively across product categories. Find alternative promotions to "25% off" to avoid losses.
Prioritize Grocery, Home Care, and Appliances over Personal Care during festivals for better results.
